# Lecture 02

We start this week by answering a few questions about setting up your own work environment. Then we will create two sample programs that 
illustrate most of what we have done so far. The programs also include some of the ideas from upcoming weeks.

## 1. Introduction
## 2. Your Kit: IDE, Operating System, and Hardware
## 3. Program 1: Temperature Statistics
## 4. Program 2: Password Generation
## 5. A Summary

### Program 1

A weather station takes readings throughout the day, from 8am to 8pm, at three hour intervals.
The temperature readings are stored with the scale "C" as the last character.
Write a program to find the maximum, minimum, range, and average temperatures through a day.

### Program 2

Good, memorable, passwords can be generated by concatenating three random words. Write a program that
generates such passwords. The user should be able to enter the number of passwords needed (maximum 20), 
and a neat list should be displayed.
