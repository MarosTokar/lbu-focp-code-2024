Dear Gwalia! I know there are,
Towns lovelier than ours.
And fairer hills and loftier far,
And groves more full of flowers.

And boskier woods more blithe with spring,
And bright with birds' adorning.
And sweeter bards than I to sing,
Their praise this beautious morning.

By Cader Idris, tempest-torn,
Or Moel y Wyddfa's glory.
Carnedd Llewelyn beauty born,
Plinlimmon old in story.

By mountains where King Arthur dreams,
By Penmaen Mawr defiant.
Llareggub Hill a molehill seems,
A pygmy to a giant.

By Sawdde, Senni, Dovey, Dee,
Edw, Eden, Aled, all.
Taff and Towy broad and free,
Llyfnant with its waterfall.

Claerwen, Cleddau, Dulas, Daw,
Ely, Gwili, Ogwr, Nedd.
Small is our River Dewi, lord,
A baby on a rushy bed.

By Carreg Cennen, King of time,
Our heron head is only.
A bit of stone with seaweed spread,
Where gulls come to be lonely.

A tiny dingle is Milk Wood,
By golden Grove 'neath Grongar.
But let me choose and oh! I should,
Love all my life and longer.

To stroll among our trees and stray,
In Goosegog Lane, on Donkey Down.
And hear the Dewi sing all day,
And never, never leave the town.
